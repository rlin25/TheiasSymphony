## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **System Audio Capture**: Real-time capture of system audio at 44.1kHz
- **Beat Detection**: Advanced beat detection with intensity levels and dramatic visual response
- **Rainbow Color Cycling**: Smooth color transitions through the spectrum with beat responsiveness
- **Multiple Visualization Modes**: Minimalist waveform, filled areas, circular patterns, and frequency bars
- **Fullscreen Support**: Toggle between windowed and fullscreen modes
- **Real-time Controls**: Adjust sensitivity, color speed, and smoothing in real-time
- **Performance Optimized**: Smooth 60 FPS rendering with efficient audio processing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/theias-symphony.git
cd theias-symphony
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

### Building for Distribution

Build for all platforms:
```bash
npm run build
```

Build for specific platforms:
```bash
npm run build:win    # Windows
npm run build:mac    # macOS
npm run build:linux  # Linux
```

## Usage

### Basic Controls

- **F11**: Toggle fullscreen mode
- **H**: Show/hide control panel
- **?**: Show/hide keyboard shortcuts help
- **R**: Reset all settings to defaults
- **ESC**: Exit fullscreen mode

### Control Panel

Access the control panel by pressing **H** or clicking anywhere on the visualization. The panel includes:

- **Beat Sensitivity**: Adjust how responsive the visualization is to beats (0.1 - 2.0)
- **Color Cycle Speed**: Control the speed of color transitions (0.1 - 3.0)
- **Waveform Smoothing**: Smooth out rapid changes in the waveform (0.1 - 1.0)

### Visualization Modes

The application currently supports a minimalist waveform style with:
- Rainbow color cycling
- Beat-responsive scaling
- Particle effects on strong beats
- Shockwave effects for dramatic beats
- Smooth color transitions

## Technical Details

### Audio Processing

- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz
- **Buffer Size**: 1024 samples
- **Audio Analysis**: FFT-based frequency analysis with Hanning window
- **Beat Detection**: Energy-based algorithm with adaptive thresholds

### Performance

- **Target FPS**: 60 FPS
- **CPU Usage**: Typically < 15% on modern hardware
- **Memory Usage**: < 200MB during normal operation
- **Audio Latency**: < 50ms

```

### Audio Capture Implementation

The application uses platform-specific audio capture:

- **Windows**: WASAPI loopback capture
- **macOS**: Core Audio / AVAudioEngine
- **Linux**: PulseAudio capture

Audio capture runs in a subprocess for better performance and isolation.

### Dependencies

- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop framework
- **fftjs**: Fast Fourier Transform implementation
- **electron-builder**: Application packaging and distribution

## Configuration

The application stores configuration in platform-specific locations:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/TheiasSymphony/config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/TheiasSymphony/config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/theias-symphony/config.json`

### Configuration Options

```json
{
  "audio": {
    "sampleRate": 44100,
    "bufferSize": 1024,
    "smoothingFactor": 0.8
  },
  "visualization": {
    "style": "minimalist",
    "frameRate": 60,
    "amplitude": 0.3
  },
  "colors": {
    "mode": "rainbow",
    "speed": 1.0,
    "saturation": 100
  },
  "beatDetection": {
    "sensitivity": 0.7,
    "energyThreshold": 1.3
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues

**No audio detected:**
1. Check system audio permissions
2. Ensure audio is playing from other applications
3. Try adjusting the beat sensitivity
4. Restart the application

**Poor performance:**
1. Lower the frame rate in settings
2. Reduce particle count in animations
3. Disable advanced effects
4. Check for other CPU-intensive applications

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Windows:**
- May require "Stereo Mix" to be enabled in audio settings
- Some audio drivers don't support loopback capture

**macOS:**
- Requires microphone permission for audio capture
- May need to install additional audio routing software

**Linux:**
- Requires PulseAudio to be running
- Check audio group permissions
